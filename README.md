Hi I am Jdmone24. I work heavily with automation and never stopped since taking my first programming courses at College. Although in my current role I mainly live within
a Powershell Studio. I love to stay ontop of my programming skills on the side with fun side projects that often times end up
benefiting me in the real world. Right now I mainly do my projects in Python but I'm not stranger to working with C#, and Java. Most of my recent projects involve
pulling data from various sources and analyzing them using several packages such as Textblog to scan for meaningful data that can be used for very targetted data analysis.


I finally decided to create a Github for myself to showcase some of the projects I have worked on in the past (if I can still find the code) and projects I am pursuing still.
