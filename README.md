Hi I am Jdmone24. I work heavily with automation and never stopped since taking my first programming courses at College. Although in my current role I mainly live within
a Powershell Studio (still automating - don't worry), I love to stay ontop of my programming skills on the side with fun side projects that often times end up
benefiting me in the real world. My programming classes in college translated very well into the real world as getting a taste for automating tasks and projects carried right into
my professional career. 

I finally decided to create a Github for myself to showcase some of the projects I have worked on in the past (if I can still find the code) and projects I am pursuing still.
